## Purpose

These guidelines govern the use of "TriLateral Voice," "TLV," and related trademarks owned by The TriLateral Voice (TLV) Foundation Series (the "Foundation"). Our goal is to:

- Protect the integrity and reputation of the TLV framework
- Prevent confusion about official TLV materials and endorsements
- Prevent corporate capture or misappropriation of the TLV name
- Enable legitimate community use while maintaining quality standards
- Support the TLV mission of accessible, dignity-centered communication

**The TLV name is a community asset held in trust by the Foundation for the benefit of all who use and contribute to TLV.**

---

## Trademarks Covered

The following marks are trademarks of The TLV Foundation Series:

1. **"TriLateral Voice"** (word mark)
2. **"TLV"** (word mark)
3. **TLV Logo** (if/when created - design mark)
4. **Variations and derivatives** that could cause confusion

**Status:** Trademark applications filed with USPTO. Common law rights claimed from first use.

---

## General Principles

### What Trademarks Protect:

✅ **The TLV name and brand identity** — preventing others from creating confusion or damaging the reputation

### What Trademarks Do NOT Protect:

❌ **The TLV protocols and content** — these are freely available under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license  
❌ **The ideas and concepts** — anyone can create similar frameworks with different names  
❌ **Descriptive use** — you can refer to TLV in text, research, articles

### Key Distinction:

- **You can USE the TLV framework** (under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)
- **You cannot USE the TLV trademark** in certain ways without permission (see below)

---

## Permitted Uses (No Permission Required)

### ✅ Descriptive and Referential Use

You may refer to TriLateral Voice or TLV without permission when:

**In Writing, Research, and Education:**
- "This research applies the TriLateral Voice framework"
- "We teach TLV protocols in our conflict resolution course"

- "See the TriLateral Voice documentation for more information"

**In Attribution:**
- Citing TLV materials in research papers
- Attributing TLV source in derivative works (required by CC BY-NC-SA license)

### ✅ Non-Commercial Community Use

**You may use TLV trademarks without permission for:**

- Personal websites about your TLV practice (clearly marked as unofficial)
- Non-profit community groups studying/practicing TLV
