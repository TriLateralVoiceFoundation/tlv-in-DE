## Why Commercial Licensing?

The TriLateral Voice (TLV) Framework is **free for non-commercial use** under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. This enables individuals, educators, non-profits, and government agencies to use TLV without cost or permission.

However, **for-profit commercial use requires a commercial license** from The TLV Foundation Series. Commercial licensing serves multiple purposes:

✅ **Supports TLV Development**: License fees fund ongoing framework development, research, documentation, and community resources

✅ **Ensures Quality**: Commercial licensees meet quality standards and receive official recognition and support

✅ **Protects the Brand**: Licensing prevents misuse and ensures TLV name represents integrity and mission-alignment

✅ **Enables Free Access**: Revenue from commercial licenses keeps TLV free for mission-aligned non-commercial uses

✅ **Provides Support**: Commercial licensees receive professional support, updates, and resources

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Can I try TLV before committing to a commercial license?**

Yes! You can:
- Use TLV for personal learning and development (free)
- Implement TLV in a non-profit context (free)
- Do limited pilot testing with pro bono clients
- Attend public TLV training or workshops

When you're ready to offer commercial services, apply for a license.

### **What if I'm already using TLV commercially without a license?**

Contact us immediately to regularize your situation. We're happy to work with you to:
- Understand your current use
- Determine appropriate licensing
- Develop reasonable transition plan
- Grandfather existing client commitments

We prioritize education over enforcement, but ongoing unlicensed commercial use may result in legal action.

### **Can I sublicense TLV to my clients or partners?**

No. Your license is non-transferable and non-sublicensable. Your clients receive services from you; they don't receive independent rights to TLV marks.

If your clients want to implement TLV themselves commercially, they need their own license.

### **What if TLV Framework changes or updates?**

Foundation will:
- Provide advance notice of major changes when possible
- Offer support for transitioning to updated protocols
- Not make changes designed specifically to harm commercial licensees
- Consult with commercial licensee community on significant updates

You're encouraged to contribute feedback and improvements based on your commercial experience.

### **Can I modify TLV protocols for my clients?**

Yes, within limits:
- You can adapt implementation for specific client contexts
- You can create proprietary tools and systems that use TLV
- You can develop training materials and curricula
- You must accurately represent core TLV methodology
- Significant modifications should be disclosed and may require approval

### **What happens if my business grows significantly?**

Great! For revenue share models:
- Percentages increase with revenue tiers automatically
- Higher revenue = more support to Foundation mission

For fixed fee models:
- We may discuss tier adjustment at renewal
- We'll work with you to ensure fee remains fair and reasonable

### **Do you offer payment plans?**

For annual fees: Yes, quarterly installments available

For revenue share: Already structured as quarterly payments

For startups/small businesses: We'll work with you on reasonable arrangements

### **What about international licensing?**

Yes, we license worldwide. Terms are the same but:
- Consider currency exchange for USD payments
- May need to address international tax/legal considerations
- Same quality standards apply globally

### **Can non-profits get commercial licenses?**

Non-profits with earned income activities that use TLV commercially should get a commercial license for those activities.

However:
- Reduced rates available (Academic/Small Non-Profit option)
- Mission-aligned non-profits get favorable terms
- Core mission work (non-commercial) remains free

### **How do I prove revenue for revenue share reporting?**

Quarterly reports should include:
- Total gross revenue from TLV-based services
- Breakdown by service type
- Good faith certification by authorized officer

Foundation may audit once annually if concerns arise. Most licensees never experience audit—we operate on trust and good faith.
