## What Is TriLateral Voice?

TriLateral Voice (TLV) is an acknowledgement of the full dimensionality of human communication, and how it is driven by our environment, experience, and desire for expression of self—seeking to be "known" and understood.

When we speak, we do so with intent, motivation, and purpose. The drivers of our speech have existed and had their impact *before* the moment we speak, and our aims extend *beyond* the moment of speech. This is how lived experience impacts the "now" as well as the future, shaping what you say, how you feel, and who you are today.

The concept of the **Tri** (or "Three") **Lateral** ("relating to") **Voice** ("the mind as it produces verbal thoughts") embodies the ideal that these three dimensions **speak as one** or **as a whole**.

## Why Three Voices? (TLV Explanation, Clean Version)

### A Framework for Authentic Witnessing

TLV’s three voices represent three distinct but integrated dimensions of authentic human communication:

1. **Speaker’s Voice**
   - What is expressed outwardly: the account, narrative, or statement directed toward others.
2. **Emotional/Somatic Voice**
   - What is felt internally: the emotional response and embodied experience as communication takes place.
3. **Observer’s Voice (Witness)**
   - The meta-perspective: the act of witnessing both expression and feeling, cultivating self-reflection and awareness.

**A Note on Two Ways to Use Observer's Voice:**

The Observer's Voice works in two ways:

**For yourself (Internal):** When you notice your own thoughts and feelings with curiosity—asking "Why am I thinking/feeling this?" instead of just reacting. This is like stepping back to watch yourself, which helps you understand your patterns and make conscious choices.

**By others (External):** When someone documenting your communication adds context—noting patterns, explaining circumstances, or describing significance. This helps future readers understand not just what you said, but why it mattered.

Both are valuable. Both help preserve the full story.

For more detail, see: *Understanding the Observer's Voice: Internal vs. External Witnessing*

The third voice—the Observer or Witness—is vital. Most communication is directed outward, but genuine understanding comes only when we witness ourselves. The third voice is the practice of observing and making meaning of what we say and feel, integrating past experience with present reality. It is where dimensionality and dignity are established: by recognizing fully both our spoken truth and our internal response.

**Why three?** Because without the witness, communication remains incomplete. We are not only speakers and feelers—we are also witnesses to our own process and, through that, the process of others. To foster authentic human sovereignty and dignity, we must add the capacity to observe and reflect.

TLV is built on this principle: shared understanding requires not just the exchange of words and feelings, but also the shared act of witnessing lived experience—by those who have lived it and those seeking to understand.

## The Three Voices: Understanding the Dimensions

Every time we communicate, three dimensions are present and interwoven:

### 1. **What You Say**: The Speaker's Voice

This is the surface layer—the actual words, their technical meaning, and their cultural weight. But it's more than just dictionary definitions. The words you choose carry personal history, situational context, and cultural significance.

**Example:** When someone says "I'm fine," the words may seem simple, but they're shaped by experience, context, and what the speaker wants to convey (or conceal).

### 2. **How It Feels**: The Emotional/Somatic Voice

Communication is not just mental—it's physical and emotional. When you speak or listen, you experience bodily sensations, emotional undercurrents, and affective states. TLV acknowledges these felt experiences as essential parts of communication.

**Example:** Saying "I'm excited" might come with a fluttering in your chest, warmth in your face, or tension in your shoulders. These bodily sensations are part of the message.

### 3. **Why It Matters**: The Observer's Voice

Beyond words and feelings lies the broader significance—the context, patterns, and deeper meaning. This dimension asks: What does this moment mean in the larger story? What cultural, personal, or historical patterns are at play?

**Example:** A child saying "I don't want to go to school" might signal fear, social struggles, or learning challenges—contexts that give the statement its true weight.

**An Important Note About TLV and Professional Care:**

TLV is about **learning to voice** what hasn't been said and **being heard** completely. It is **not** therapy or medical treatment.

- If you're working with a TLV-trained Witness, they are helping you tell your full story—not providing mental health care
- TLV can help inform professional care, but it doesn't replace it
- If you need therapy, counseling, or mental health support, please seek qualified professionals

TLV's gift is giving voice to your complete experience. Professional care provides treatment and healing support. Both can be valuable, and they serve different purposes.

## Why Does This Matter?

### Being Known and Understood

At the heart of TLV is a simple human need: to be truly known and understood. When we communicate, we want our full experience to be received—not just our words, but our feelings, our histories, and our meanings.

TLV provides a framework for honoring this complexity, helping us:
- Express ourselves more authentically
- Listen more deeply to others
- Preserve meaningful communication for the future
- Bridge gaps in understanding across cultures, generations, and contexts



## Core Principles to Remember

As you explore TLV, these foundational principles can guide your understanding:

**On Your Past:**
- "A past we have survived is not a defect, it is a victory we need to claim."
- "Life is the reward for surviving our past."

Your history is part of your strength, not a limitation. What you've survived has shaped who you are.

**On Your Emotional Responses:**
- "No one can 'make' you mad—it is an internal response to external input."

You have agency in how you respond to the world, even when situations are difficult. (Important note: This principle applies when you have safety and genuine choice—not in situations of immediate danger or violence where your priority must be survival and safety.)

**Learning to Ask "Why":**

One of the most powerful tools in TLV practice is learning to ask yourself "Why":
- "Why am I feeling this way?"
- "Am I safe right now, or is this a feeling from the past or worry about the future?"
- "What do I need to do to protect myself from real consequences?"
- "Is this response helping me, or is this a battle I've already won?"

These questions help you understand your feelings and choose your path forward with clarity.

### Grounding Communication in Reality

TLV is grounded in the reality of how communication actually works. Research in psychology, linguistics, and anthropology shows that communication is:
- **Collaborative**: We work together to create shared understanding
- **Embodied**: Our bodies and emotions are inseparable from our words
- **Contextual**: Meaning depends on history, culture, and situation

TLV doesn't try to revolutionize communication—it simply acknowledges what has always been true and provides tools to document and honor it.

## How TLV Protocols Work Together

Think of TLV protocols like tools in a toolbox—each tool works perfectly on its own, but sometimes using multiple tools together helps you do an even better job.

**Each Protocol Stands Alone:**
- You can use just the Communication/Speech Protocol to have better conversations
- You can use just the Transcription Protocol to document important discussions
- You can use just the Conflict Mediation Protocol to resolve disputes

**Protocols Can Combine for More:**
- In a conflict involving people who speak different languages, you might combine Conflict Mediation with Translation Protocol
- When documenting an important conversation, you might combine Transcription with Communication/Speech Protocol
- For cross-cultural understanding, you might use Transcription and Translation together

**You Choose What You Need:**  
TLV gives you the freedom to use what serves your situation. There's no requirement to use everything—just what helps you communicate authentically and be understood completely.

## The TLV Protocols: Tools for Practice

TLV includes several practical protocols to guide its use:

### Transcription Protocol
Captures not just words, but delivery, context, and significance.

### Translation Protocol
Maintains the full dimensionality of meaning when translating across languages and cultures.

### Communication/Speech Protocol
Helps speakers articulate their full experience and listeners receive it authentically.

### Emotional and Feeling Vocabulary
Provides precise language for describing emotional and somatic experiences, with attention to cultural and contextual nuance.

Each protocol is designed to be accessible and practical, supporting clear and authentic communication.

## Moving Forward: A Grounded Philosophy

TLV is not a movement or a revolution. It is a **practical acknowledgment** of how communication actually works and a set of **tools for honoring that reality**.

The philosophy of TLV is:
- **Grounded**: Rooted in research and lived experience
- **Inclusive**: Accessible to anyone, in any context
- **Respectful**: Honoring the dignity and complexity of every voice
- **Practical**: Focused on real human needs and applications

As TLV develops, it will continue to prioritize:
- Clarity over grandiosity
- Accessibility for all people
- Respect for cultural, personal, and historical diversity
- Authenticity in expression and documentation

## Conclusion: The Heart of TLV

TriLateral Voice exists to acknowledge and document the full dimensionality of human communication—the interplay of environment, experience, and intention that shapes every word we speak.

When we attend to all three voices—what we say, how it feels, and why it matters—we honor the complexity and dignity of being human. We create space for understanding, empathy, and connection.

TLV is a framework for **speaking as a whole** and **being heard as a whole**.

Your voice—and your lived experience—matters.
