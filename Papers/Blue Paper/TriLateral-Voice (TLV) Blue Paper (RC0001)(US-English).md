## Abstract

This blue paper presents TriLateral Voice (TLV) as a research framework for the documentation, analysis, and understanding of human experience in communication. TLV integrates phenomenological, embodied cognition, and grounding-in-communication traditions, operationalizing a structured multidimensional approach for capturing the interplay of verbal content, emotional-somatic experience, and contextual significance in communicative acts. We detail foundational concepts, methodological architecture, and research implications, with attention to validity, cross-cultural applicability, and potential expansion across disciplines including communication studies, linguistics, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience.

## 1. Introduction

TLV addresses limitations in traditional communication documentation by introducing a tripartite analytic structure: Speaker's Voice (what is said), Emotional/Somatic Voice (how it feels), and Observer's Voice (why it matters). This systematic approach acknowledges the explicit, embodied, and contextual dimensions of communicative events as an integrated whole. 

TLV is positioned as both a methodological protocol and a conceptual framework, designed to support rigorous qualitative inquiry, reproducible research practices, and ethical documentation of lived experience. It recognizes communication as temporally embedded—shaped by prior experience and oriented toward future meaning—and provides tools for honoring this temporal dimensionality.

## Why Three Voices? (TLV Explanation)

### A Framework for Authentic Witnessing

TLV’s three voices represent three distinct but integrated dimensions of authentic human communication:

1. **Speaker’s Voice**
   - What is expressed outwardly: the account, narrative, or statement directed toward others.
2. **Emotional/Somatic Voice**
   - What is felt internally: the emotional response and embodied experience as communication takes place.
3. **Observer’s Voice (Witness)**
   - The meta-perspective: the act of witnessing both expression and feeling, cultivating self-reflection and awareness.

The third voice—the Observer or Witness—is vital. Most communication is directed outward, but genuine understanding comes only when we witness ourselves. The third voice is the practice of observing and making meaning of what we say and feel, integrating past experience with present reality. It is where dimensionality and dignity are established: by recognizing fully both our spoken truth and our internal response.

**Why three?** Because without the witness, communication remains incomplete. We are not only speakers and feelers—we are also witnesses to our own process and, through that, the process of others. To foster authentic human sovereignty and dignity, we must add the capacity to observe and reflect.

TLV is built on this principle: shared understanding requires not just the exchange of words and feelings, but also the shared act of witnessing lived experience—by those who have lived it and those seeking to understand.

## 2. Theoretical Integration

### 2.1 Grounding in Communication

Building on Clark and colleagues' foundational work, TLV recognizes that communication is a collaborative achievement requiring continuous coordination between participants. Grounding theory emphasizes that understanding is not simply transmitted but jointly constructed through evidence, clarification, and mutual adjustment. TLV's three-voice structure provides systematic methods for documenting and supporting this grounding process, attending to how speakers and listeners establish common ground across verbal, emotional, and contextual dimensions.

### 2.2 Phenomenology and Hermeneutics

TLV leverages phenomenological frameworks emphasizing intentionality, lived experience, and embodied perception. The lifeworld concept underpins TLV's approach to meaning-making, with attention to subjective realities, contextual embedding, and the preservation of first-person perspective. Hermeneutic attention to interpretation and contextual understanding informs TLV's Observer's Voice, which explicitly attends to the broader significance and pattern recognition essential to meaning.

### 2.3 Embodied Cognition and Affective Science

Current research in embodied cognition demonstrates that sensorimotor experience, bodily states, and emotional processes are constitutive of meaning and communication, not merely accompanying features. TLV's Emotional/Somatic Voice systematically documents these embodied dimensions through intensity mapping, somatic signature annotation, and cross-modal attention, aligning with contemporary affective science and somatic psychology.

### 2.4 Lived Experience and Person-Centered Approaches

Contemporary research emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and integrating lived experience in documentation, care, and inquiry. TLV provides structured methods for person-centered practice, supporting dignity preservation, cultural responsiveness, and authentic representation of individual and collective experience across diverse populations and contexts.

### 2.5 Foundational Principles and Axioms

TLV practice is grounded in principles derived from lived experience research and trauma-informed frameworks:

**Resilience and Agency:**
- Past trauma and adversity are reframed as survived experiences representing strength and victory
- Life continuation represents inherent resilience and adaptive capacity
- Emotional responses are understood as internal processes influenced by, but not determined by, external events

**Contextual Application:**  
These principles apply within contexts where individuals have genuine agency and safety. Research applications must attend to power dynamics, structural constraints, and situations where agency is genuinely limited (e.g., violence, coercion, systemic oppression). The framework acknowledges that "flight to safety" must be genuinely possible for agency-based principles to apply ethically.

**Research Implications:**  
These axioms inform TLV's person-centered, dignity-preserving approach while requiring careful attention to context, power, and structural factors in research design and interpretation.

## 3. Methodological Architecture

### 3.1 The Three-Voice Structure

TLV operationalizes multi-dimensional documentation through three coordinated analytic streams:

#### Speaker's Voice
- Verbatim content capture with attention to linguistic precision
- Technical and cultural annotation of meaning
- Delivery style, situational context, and gravity documentation
- Personal and collective history embedded in language use
- Intensity calibration (1–10 scale) for contextual weight

#### Emotional/Somatic Voice
- Emotional signature identification and description
- Somatic mapping (bodily location, sensation quality, intensity)
- Authenticity and congruence markers
- Intensity mapping (1–10 scale) for affective and physical experience
- Cultural and temporal contextualization of emotional expression

#### Observer's Voice
- Contextual significance and pattern analysis
- Temporal translation (immediate, generational, civilizational)
- Cultural and historical positioning
- Relational dynamics and social context
- Meta-level reflection on meaning-making processes

### Observer's Voice Methodology: Dual Functions

TLV's Observer's Voice operates on two levels with distinct methodological implications:

**Internal Observer's Voice (Phenomenological Self-Reflection):**

Draws on phenomenological and metacognitive traditions, this involves the communicator's own bracketing of immediate reactive experience to witness their process. Research questions include:
- How do individuals develop meta-awareness?
- What enables the shift from reactive to reflective stance?
- How does self-witnessing capacity vary across cultures and contexts?
- What are the therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic applications?

**External Observer's Voice (Ethnographic Documentation):**

Draws on ethnographic and grounded theory traditions, this involves systematic documentation of patterns, context, and significance by trained observers. Research questions include:
- What makes Observer documentation valid and reliable?
- How do we distinguish documentation from interpretation?
- What training enables high-quality external observation?
- How does observer positionality affect what is documented?

**Methodological Implications:**

Research using TLV must specify which Observer's Voice application is being studied and employ appropriate methods. Internal Observer research may use phenomenological or introspective methods; external Observer research may use inter-rater reliability, ethnographic validation, and grounded theory approaches.

### 3.2 Protocol Structure

TLV is implemented through four interconnected protocols:

**Transcription Protocol:** Multi-layered documentation preserving verbal, emotional, somatic, and contextual dimensions

**Translation Protocol:** Cross-linguistic and cross-cultural translation maintaining full dimensionality of meaning and experience

**Communication/Speech Protocol:** Real-time guidance for speakers and listeners attending to all three voices

**Emotional and Feeling Vocabulary:** Enhanced lexicon providing precise terminology for emotional and somatic description, with etymological, cultural, and intensity information

### 3.3 Scope and Methodological Boundaries

**TLV as Documentation, Not Intervention:**  
It is critical to distinguish TLV as a documentation and analytical framework from clinical or therapeutic intervention. TLV methods are designed to:
- Document and analyze communication with full dimensionality
- Support research on communication patterns and meaning-making
- Inform care and practice through rich qualitative data

TLV does **not** constitute:
- Clinical treatment or therapy
- Mental health intervention
- Medical diagnosis or care
- Replacement for professional healthcare services

**Research Ethics and Practitioner Training:**  
TLV practitioners must understand these boundaries clearly. In research contexts, TLV documentation may inform clinical care but should not be positioned as therapeutic intervention. This distinction is essential for ethical practice and valid research design.
