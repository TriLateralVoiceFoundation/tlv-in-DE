## What is TLV?

TriLateral Voice (TLV) is a comprehensive communication framework that documents and honors the full dimensionality of human experience. Unlike traditional communication approaches that focus solely on words, TLV systematically attends to three integrated dimensions:

1. **Speaker's Voice** - What you say (the technical content and words)
2. **Emotional/Somatic Voice** - How it feels (the embodied experience)
3. **Observer's Voice** - Why it matters (the contextual significance and witness)

TLV provides structured protocols for transcription, translation, conflict mediation, and authentic communication—ensuring that the complexity of human expression is preserved with dignity, clarity, and respect.

### Mission

To document and honor the full dimensionality of human communication, recognizing how environment, experience, and the need for authentic self-expression shape what we say, how we feel, and who we are.

## The Three Voices Explained

### 1. Speaker's Voice: What You Say
The technical content—verbatim words, factual information, narrative structure, and expressed intentions.

### 2. Emotional/Somatic Voice: How It Feels
The embodied experience—primary emotions, physical sensations, intensity levels, and authenticity indicators.

### 3. Observer's Voice: Why It Matters
The contextual significance—cultural and historical context, pattern recognition, temporal factors, and meta-awareness.

**Why Three?** Because without the witness, communication remains incomplete. We are not only speakers and feelers—we are also witnesses to our own process and, through that, the process of others.

## Core Protocols

TLV is built on a modular system of interconnected protocols:

| Protocol | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Communication & Speech** | Framework for understanding and documenting your own communication | RC0001 |
| **Transcription** | Captures spoken content with full attention to delivery and context | RC0001 |
| **Translation** | Maintains dimensionality when translating across languages and cultures | RC0001 |
| **Emotional Vocabulary** | Precise terminology for describing emotional and somatic experiences | RC0001 |
| **Conflict Mediation** | Specialized application for documenting and resolving conflicts | D0001 (Draft) |
| **Audio Description** | Accessibility protocol for visual content | D0001 (Draft) |
| **Captioning** | Comprehensive captioning beyond simple transcription | D0001 (Draft) |

Each protocol can function independently while also enabling seamless integration for comprehensive documentation.

---

## Applications

TLV can be applied across diverse contexts:

- **Personal Life**: Self-reflection, journaling, understanding communication patterns
- **Relationships & Family**: Improving clarity, processing conflict, deepening connection
- **Healthcare & Therapy**: Person-centered care, documenting patient experiences (as complement, not replacement)
- **Education**: Teaching communication complexity, developing emotional intelligence
- **Workplace**: Clear organizational communication, conflict understanding, leadership development
- **Research**: Qualitative methodology, phenomenological studies, preserving authentic voices
- **History & Legacy**: Oral history projects, generational storytelling, cultural documentation

## Foundational Principles

TLV is grounded in three key axioms:

1. **A past we have survived is not a defect, it is a victory we need to claim.**
2. **Life is the reward for surviving our past.**
3. **No one can make you mad—it is an internal response to external input.**

These principles emphasize **agency, resilience**, and the recognition that emotional responses are internal processes influenced by—but not determined by—external events.

---

## Important Scope Clarification

**TLV is NOT therapy or clinical treatment.**

TLV documents experience—it does not diagnose, treat, or provide mental health care. While TLV methods can inform care and support authentic understanding, they **do not replace professional mental health services, medical treatment, or clinical therapy**.

If you're experiencing persistent emotional distress, thoughts of self-harm, trauma responses, or mental health crisis, please reach out to appropriate resources:
- Mental health professionals
- Crisis hotlines
- Trusted support networks
- Medical providers
