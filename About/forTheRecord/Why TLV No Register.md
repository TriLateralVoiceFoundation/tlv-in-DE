# Why TLV Doesn't Use "Register" Terminology

**A Note on Linguistic Framing and TLV's Mission**

---

## The Question

Linguistic analysis often employs the concept of "register"—the variation in language use based on formality, context, and social situation. Given TLV's comprehensive approach to documenting communication, why doesn't the framework explicitly incorporate register as a documented dimension?

---

## The Answer

**TLV deliberately excludes "register" as a primary analytical category because register functions as a classist sorting mechanism that judges the speaker rather than understanding the communication.**

### What Register Actually Measures:

Register categorizes speech along hierarchies of:
- **Formality** (formal, informal, casual, intimate)
- **Education level** (academic, professional, colloquial, vernacular)
- **Social class markers** (prestige dialect vs. working-class speech)
- **Proficiency judgments** (proper vs. improper, correct vs. incorrect)
- **Power positioning** (authoritative vs. subordinate communication styles)

### The Problem with Register:

Register analysis inherently **evaluates the speaker's social position, educational background, and perceived legitimacy** rather than focusing on **what the speaker is actually communicating and why it matters**.

**Register asks:** "How educated/sophisticated/proper is this speaker?"

**TLV asks:** "What is this speaker communicating, how does it feel, and why does it matter?"

---

## Why This Matters for TLV

### 1. **Register Obscures Content with Judgment**

When we categorize speech by register, we risk:
- Dismissing valuable content because it's expressed in "lower" register
- Elevating empty content expressed in "higher" register
- Conflating education level with truth value
- Privileging dominant dialect/class communication patterns
- Missing authentic experience communicated in non-prestige language

**Example:** A working-class person describing systemic injustice in vernacular English may be dismissed as "informal" or "improper" by register analysis, while an academic's theoretical discussion of the same issue in formal register receives automatic credibility—regardless of which speaker has actually lived the experience being discussed.

### 2. **TLV Documents Authenticity, Not Prestige**

TLV's intensity mapping and three-voice framework already capture what's valuable about register without the classist baggage:

- **Lexical choices** (part of intensity mapping) capture word selection without judging it as "high" or "low" register
- **Cultural context** (Observer's Voice) explains why certain language choices were made
- **Emotional authenticity** (Emotional/Somatic Voice) is independent of formality or education level
- **Paralinguistic markers** document tone, pacing, emphasis—the *how* of speech—without hierarchical judgment

**What matters:** Whether communication is authentic to the speaker, appropriate to context, and effective in conveying meaning—not whether it conforms to dominant class/educational norms.

### 3. **Register Reinforces Oppressive Hierarchies**

The concept of register emerged from and perpetuates:
- **Class hierarchies**: "Proper" speech belongs to educated/upper classes
- **Colonial language politics**: Indigenous and colonized languages/dialects marked as "inferior"
- **Gatekeeping**: Formal register becomes barrier to participation in institutions
- **Racism and classism**: AAVE, working-class dialects, immigrant speech patterns devalued

**TLV's alternative:** Document *why* someone chooses particular language (cultural identity, audience relationship, code-switching for safety, authentic self-expression) without judging the choice as higher or lower on a prestige hierarchy.

### 4. **TLV Honors All Voices Equally**

The entire TLV framework is built on the principle that **every voice deserves to be documented with equal dignity**—whether spoken by a PhD or a person who never finished school, whether in academic English or AAVE, whether in formal oration or intimate conversation.

**Register-based analysis violates this principle** by introducing hierarchical evaluation where TLV seeks equal witnessing.

## What TLV Documents Instead

Rather than register, TLV captures:

### **Context-Appropriate Communication** (Observer's Voice):
- Who is speaking to whom?
- What is the relationship and power dynamic?
- What cultural/social context shapes language choices?
- Why did the speaker choose this way of communicating?

### **Authentic Expression** (All Three Voices):
- Is the speaker communicating genuinely or performing?
- Does the language choice reflect speaker's identity and community?
- What emotional truth is being conveyed regardless of formality?
- What patterns and meanings emerge in the speaker's own terms?

### **Cultural and Community Belonging** (Observer's Voice):
- Does this communication reflect specific cultural or community language patterns?
- Is the speaker code-switching, and if so, why?
- What in-group references, slang, or specialized language is present?
- How does this communication position the speaker within their communities?

---

## Practical Implications

### **For Transcription:**
- Don't "correct" grammar or word choice
- Preserve exact phrasing, including non-standard forms
- Note cultural/community language patterns without judgment
- Explain context without implying speaker "should have" used different register

### **For Translation:**
- Preserve informal/vernacular/non-prestige language in target language
- Don't automatically "elevate" to formal register when translating
- Maintain speaker's relationship to language (code-switching, mixing, etc.)
- Explain cultural language choices without imposing target language's prestige norms

### **For Analysis:**
- Focus on meaning, authenticity, and cultural context
- Avoid hierarchical categorization by formality/education
- Recognize power in all forms of communication
- Center speaker's voice and community, not evaluator's standards

## When Context/Formality Information Is Relevant

TLV still documents contextual and relational information that register *attempts* to capture:

**Document as Observer's Voice context:**
- "This conversation took place in a professional medical consultation" (explains formal language choices)
- "Speaker code-switched between AAVE and Standard English depending on audience" (explains language mixing)
- "This is ceremonial/ritual speech following community protocols" (explains specialized language)
- "Speaker chose intimate/familiar language to signal trust" (explains relationship-based choices)

**The difference:** TLV documents these as **contextual choices the speaker made for reasons** rather than as **hierarchical categories for evaluation**.

---

## Summary

**TLV excludes "register" because:**

1. Register judges speakers rather than understanding communication
2. Register reinforces class, race, and colonial hierarchies
3. TLV already captures useful information (context, relationship, code-switching) without the classist framework
4. TLV's mission is equal dignity for all voices—incompatible with register's hierarchical sorting

**TLV documents:**
- What was communicated (content)
- How it felt (emotion and embodiment)
- Why it matters (context, culture, significance)

**TLV does not document:**
- How "proper" or "educated" the speaker sounds
- Whether the speaker conforms to prestige language norms
- Hierarchical judgments about language "quality"

---

## Closing Thought

Every human being communicates in ways shaped by their culture, community, education, and lived experience. TLV honors all of these expressions equally. We witness communication; we don't rank communicators.

**As the framework states:** "TLV documents what is present, not what we wish was present."

That includes honoring language exactly as spoken, in all its beautiful, culturally grounded, authentically human variety—without asking whether it meets someone else's standards of "correctness."
