# TriLateral Voice (TLV): An Origin Story

## Why TLV? Why Now? Why Me?

### Why Me?

TriLateral Voice began as a way to reconcile my professional expertise with my need for authentic human communication. For over 15 years, my work as a technical writer in aerospace was dedicated to creating clear, actionable instructions for complex systems—removing ambiguity to protect lives and property. Standards like ATA100, S1000D, and STE100 are invaluable for that work, but they intentionally flatten language and eliminate the dimensionality of real experience. They don’t teach you how to address ambiguity in feelings, motives, or the deeper meaning behind our actions.

Life, however, isn’t a procedure or a checklist. Most of us struggle to name what we’re feeling, where those feelings originate, and how they affect our relationships and choices. TLV emerged as my method for mapping the dimensionality of real communication, not just in technical projects but in my own lived experience. I learned to notice what I was saying, to explore why I was saying it, and to acknowledge my feelings and their roots. This practice allowed me to remove ambiguity in my own motivations, foster better engagement with others, and become an honest witness to my own life. TLV helped me, and I believe its principles can help others too.

### Why Now?

Clear, dimensional communication is more urgent than ever. Ambiguity is weaponized daily—in media, in institutions, and between people—to divide us, to confuse, or to perpetuate misunderstanding. No conversation exists in a vacuum. We’re shaped by context, history, and our own stories, and we can’t always control how others engage with us. But we can take responsibility for knowing ourselves, and in doing so, demonstrate awareness and openness that might encourage others to do the same.

Acceptance and growth require complete witnessing—not selective seeing. To be fully acknowledged means having both our faults and our strengths recognized. Our lives are shaped by the people who taught, challenged, and witnessed us, whether as mentors, loved ones, or community. By finally acknowledging the full dimensionality of ourselves, we lay the grounds for deeper understanding—first within, then beyond.

### Why Three Voices?

TLV’s three voices reflect a simple but transformative insight: authentic communication requires both expression and witnessing. The first voice is the Speaker’s Voice—what you say, directed outward to others; the second is the Emotional/Somatic Voice—what you feel and how your body responds as you say it; the third is the Observer’s Voice—the witness, your capacity for self-reflection and honest seeing. I discovered this by practicing self-inquiry—when I felt something strongly, I began to ask myself why, becoming my own witness and learning to see how my words and emotions were shaped by my past and present experiences. We are not only speakers to the world; we are witnesses to our own process. To grow, we need to observe ourselves just as carefully as we communicate with others. 

The third voice is about meta-awareness. It’s about presence. It’s about being able to say, "Here is what I said, here is what I felt, and here is what I have learned by witnessing myself in this moment." Only by owning all three dimensions can we cultivate greater clarity, dignity, and human sovereignty—in ourselves and in our communities.
