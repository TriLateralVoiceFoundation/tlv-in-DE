# Why Three Voices?

## A Framework for Authentic Witnessing

TLV’s three voices represent three distinct but integrated dimensions of authentic human communication:

1. **Speaker’s Voice**
   - What is expressed outwardly: the account, narrative, or statement directed toward others.
2. **Emotional/Somatic Voice**
   - What is felt internally: the emotional response and embodied experience as communication takes place.
3. **Observer’s Voice (Witness)**
   - The meta-perspective: the act of witnessing both expression and feeling, cultivating self-reflection and awareness.

The third voice—the Observer or Witness—is vital. Most communication is directed outward, but genuine understanding comes only when we witness ourselves. The third voice is the practice of observing and making meaning of what we say and feel, integrating past experience with present reality. It is where dimensionality and dignity are established: by recognizing fully both our spoken truth and our internal response.

**Why three?** Because without the witness, communication remains incomplete. We are not only speakers and feelers—we are also witnesses to our own process and, through that, the process of others. To foster authentic human sovereignty and dignity, we must add the capacity to observe and reflect.

TLV is built on this principle: shared understanding requires not just the exchange of words and feelings, but also the shared act of witnessing lived experience—by those who have lived it and those seeking to understand.
