## Mission

To transform audio description from basic visual narration into rich, dimensional documentation that preserves the full visual and emotional experience for blind, low-vision, and all audiences. TLV audio description honors what is seen, how it feels and resonates, and why it matters—ensuring that description provides equivalent access to visual meaning, not just object identification.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Current audio description standards provide visual access. TLV audio description provides experiential access.**

Blind and low-vision audiences deserve the same rich, nuanced understanding of visual content that sighted audiences receive through composition, color, movement, and visual storytelling. TLV audio description systematically documents all three voices of visual communication, creating descriptions that preserve emotional resonance, narrative significance, and aesthetic experience.

---

## Scope and Purpose

### What This Protocol IS:

- **An enhancement framework**: Builds on existing audio description standards (ADA, WCAG, CVAA) to add dimensional depth
- **An accessibility advancement**: Provides equivalent access to visual emotion, composition, and artistic intent
- **A documentation method**: Preserves full visual experience through strategic verbal description
- **A training resource**: Teaches audio describers to document beyond objects and actions
- **An artistic practice**: Honors visual artistry by translating it into verbal artistry

### What This Protocol IS NOT:

- **Not a replacement for standard audio description**: TLV-enhanced AD must still meet legal/technical requirements
- **Not captioning**: Audio description documents visual content; captions document audio content (see companion protocol)
- **Not interpretation or opinion**: Description documents what is visually present and its emotional/artistic effect
- **Not constant narration**: TLV description is strategic, fitting within dialogue and audio spaces
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: Implementation varies by content type, genre, and pacing

### Accessibility Note:

This protocol assumes audio description is **one component** of accessible media. Full accessibility requires:
- TLV-informed audio description (this protocol)
- TLV-enhanced captions (companion protocol)
- Accessible player controls and interfaces
- Multiple format and customization options
- Community input from blind/low-vision users

## The Three Voices in Audio Description

### 1. Observer's Voice (What Is Seen)
**The visual content objectively described**: Documents what is present in the frame, following standard audio description conventions.

**Includes:**
- Characters and their actions
- Settings and environments
- Objects relevant to narrative
- Text on screen
- Scene transitions
- Movement and physical positioning

**Standard Audio Description Rules Apply:**
- Objective, not interpretive
- Concise and clear
- Present tense
- Fits within dialogue pauses
- Describes what is seen, not why

**Note:** The Observer's Voice in audio description is **external documentary witnessing**—the describer documents visual information objectively while providing narrative and aesthetic context. This differs from internal Observer's Voice (self-witnessing) which individual viewers may engage with visual content. See: *Understanding the Observer's Voice: Internal vs. External Witnessing*

### 2. Emotional/Aesthetic Voice (How It Feels)
**The visual emotional and artistic dimensions**: Documents composition, color, lighting, cinematography, and visual elements that create emotional response.

**Includes:**
- Lighting (harsh, soft, ominous, warm, stark)
- Color palette and color symbolism
- Composition (close-up intimacy, wide shots showing isolation, etc.)
- Camera movement (shaky handheld anxiety, smooth tracking elegance)
- Visual metaphors and symbolism
- Facial expressions and body language that convey emotion
- Atmospheric visual elements (fog, shadows, light, weather)

**TLV Enhancement:**
Rather than just "dark room," provide emotional/aesthetic context:
- "Dimly lit room, single candle casting long shadows—intimate but precarious"
- "Extreme close-up on her eyes, mascara running—raw vulnerability"
- "Wide overhead shot showing his isolation in vast empty warehouse"

### 3. Narrative/Contextual Voice (Why It Matters)
**The visual storytelling and significance**: Provides context about what visual elements mean for the story, characters, and themes.

**Includes:**
- Visual callbacks and references
- Symbolic elements that carry meaning
- Foreshadowing through visual cues
- Character development shown visually
- Thematic visual patterns
- Cultural/historical visual context
- Genre conventions and visual language

**TLV Enhancement:**
Rather than just describing what appears, describe narrative significance:
- "She wears the same red scarf her mother wore in the opening scene—connection across generations"
- "His hands shake as he holds the gun—first time we see him uncertain"
- "Cherry blossoms fall as they say goodbye—visual symbol of impermanence in Japanese culture"

---

## Why Three Voices in Audio Description?

**Because description that only names objects provides partial access, not equivalent access to visual storytelling.**

### Current Standard Audio Description:
> "A woman enters a room. She sits in a chair."

**Missing for description users:**
- Visual emotion: How is the room lit? What does her body language convey?
- Aesthetic: How is the scene composed? What creates the mood?
- Narrative significance: Why does this matter? What are we meant to feel/understand?

### TLV-Enhanced Audio Description:
> "Sarah enters the darkened study, afternoon light filtering through dusty blinds casting prison-bar shadows across the floor. She sinks heavily into her father's leather chair—the first time she's sat there since his death. Her hand traces the worn armrest where his hand rested for decades."

**What TLV captures:**
- **Observer's Voice**: She enters, sits, hand movement
- **Emotional/Aesthetic Voice**: Darkened room, specific lighting creating prison-bar effect, physical heaviness of sinking
- **Narrative/Contextual Voice**: Father's chair, first time sitting there since death, physical connection through touching worn armrest

**Result**: Description users receive equivalent access to the emotional weight, visual symbolism, and narrative significance that sighted viewers experience.

---

## TLV Audio Description Principles

### 1. Describe for Emotional Equivalence
**Goal:** Listener feels what viewer feels

**Standard:** "A man walks down a hallway."

**TLV-Enhanced:** "John walks slowly down the fluorescent-lit hospital corridor, shoulders hunched, each step heavy with dread."

**Gained:** Emotional state (dread), atmospheric quality (harsh hospital lighting), physical manifestation of emotion (hunched, heavy steps)

---

### 2. Describe Composition and Cinematography
**Goal:** Convey artistic choices and their effects

**Standard:** "Two people talk."

**TLV-Enhanced:** "Extreme close-up: Maria and Tom's faces fill the frame, mere inches apart, the camera capturing every micro-expression in this moment of raw intimacy."

**Gained:** Cinematic choice (extreme close-up), spatial relationship (inches apart), artistic intent (capturing micro-expressions), emotional quality (raw intimacy)

---

### 3. Describe Visual Storytelling
**Goal:** Narrative meaning through visual elements

**Standard:** "She picks up a photograph."

**TLV-Enhanced:** "Elena's hand trembles as she lifts the old photograph—the same photo that appeared in the opening scene twenty years earlier, now faded and creased. Her young mother smiles up at her."

**Gained:** Physical emotional marker (trembling), narrative callback (opening scene), passage of time (faded, creased, "twenty years"), relational significance (young mother, emotional connection)

---

### 4. Describe Cultural and Symbolic Visuals
**Goal:** Preserve cultural meaning and visual symbolism

**Standard:** "Red lanterns hang in the street."

**TLV-Enhanced:** "Red paper lanterns line the narrow hutong alley—traditional symbols of good fortune and celebration—swaying gently in the Beijing evening breeze."

**Gained:** Cultural context (traditional symbols, specific meaning), setting specificity (hutong alley, Beijing), atmospheric detail (evening breeze, gentle movement)

---

## Practical Examples: TLV Audio Description in Action

### Example 1: Dramatic Film Scene

**Standard Audio Description:**
> "A woman sits at a kitchen table. She cries. A man enters."

**TLV-Enhanced Audio Description:**
> "Close-up: Michelle sits alone at the worn kitchen table, morning light harsh through the window, her face in her hands. Silent tears stream down her cheeks. The camera holds on her grief for a long moment. Behind her, soft footsteps. David appears in the doorway, his reflection visible in the window glass before she knows he's there—watching her break down."

**What's gained:**
- Composition (close-up intimacy)
- Lighting quality (harsh morning light)
- Time element (held moment—visual pacing)
- Visual storytelling (reflection in window—audience sees him before she does)
- Emotional depth (silent tears, breaking down)
- Setting detail (worn table—suggests economic status/history)

---

### Example 2: Horror Film Scene

**Standard Audio Description:**
> "She walks down a dark hallway. A door is open."

**TLV-Enhanced Audio Description:**
> "Handheld camera follows close behind Rachel as she creeps through the pitch-black hallway, the frame shaking with each nervous step. Ahead, a door stands ajar—the only source of sickly green light in the darkness, casting an eerie glow on her terrified face. She reaches for the doorknob. The camera pushes in tight on her trembling hand."

**What's gained:**
- Cinematography (handheld creating unease, camera push-in for tension)
- Lighting (pitch-black, sickly green—horror genre visual language)
- Pacing (creeping, each step—building tension)
- Emotional state shown visually (terrified face, trembling hand)
- Genre conventions (visual techniques horror audiences recognize)

---

### Example 3: Documentary Scene

**Standard Audio Description:**
> "Archive footage shows a protest. People hold signs."

**TLV-Enhanced Audio Description:**
> "Grainy black-and-white archive footage from 1965: Wide shot of hundreds of marchers filling the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The camera, positioned low and slightly shaky—likely handheld news camera—captures determined faces, many young, carrying hand-painted signs reading 'Voting Rights Now' and 'Freedom.' The footage quality—scratched film, flickering exposure—carries the weight of historical documentation."

**What's gained:**
- Historical context (1965, Selma, Edmund Pettus Bridge)
- Scale (hundreds of marchers, wide shot)
- Visual quality as meaning (grainy, black-and-white, scratched—authenticity markers)
- Camera technique as evidence (handheld news camera—journalistic documentation)
- Specific visual content (hand-painted signs, specific slogans)
- Demographics (many young—historical significance)
- Meta-awareness (footage quality carries weight—visual evidence of history)

---

### Example 4: Animated Film Scene

**Standard Audio Description:**
> "The characters fly through space."

**TLV-Enhanced Audio Description:**
> "Breathtaking wide shot: The spaceship soars through a nebula cloud painted in brilliant purples, pinks, and electric blues—reminiscent of aurora borealis. The animation style shifts to watercolor softness, the ship becoming a small silhouette against the cosmic canvas. The camera spirals around them in a joyous, weightless dance, the score swelling to match the visual poetry of this moment of freedom and wonder."

**What's gained:**
- Visual artistry (specific color palette, watercolor technique)
- Composition (wide shot, silhouette against cosmic canvas)
- Camera movement (spiral—matches emotional tone)
- Emotional quality (joyous, weightless, freedom, wonder)
- Artistic reference (aurora borealis comparison helps visualization)
- Animation technique (style shift—artistic choice)
- Audio-visual coordination (score swelling—multi-sensory experience)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Timing Considerations:
- Description must fit between dialogue and essential audio
- For dialogue-heavy content, prioritize most significant visual information
- For visually dense content, balance detail with comprehensibility
- Extended description tracks (separate audio) allow more comprehensive TLV description

### Prioritization Framework:

**High Priority:**
1. Visual information essential to plot/narrative
2. Character emotions shown through expression/body language
3. Visual elements creating mood/atmosphere
4. Key cinematic/compositional choices
5. Symbolic or culturally significant visuals

**Medium Priority:**
6. Setting details that enrich understanding
7. Background action relevant to themes
8. Visual callbacks and references
9. Costume/appearance when meaningful
10. Transitional visual elements

**Lower Priority:**
11. Decorative but non-meaningful background
12. Repetitive visual information
13. Purely aesthetic flourishes (unless artistically central)

### Quality Standards:

**Accuracy:**
- Visual content described truthfully
- Emotional/aesthetic descriptions match visual evidence
- Narrative significance grounded in actual visual storytelling
- Cultural elements described with appropriate context

**Clarity:**
- Concise language that creates clear mental images
- Present tense for current action
- Past tense only for flashbacks/memory
- Avoids jargon unless relevant to content

**Artistic Integrity:**
- Honors creator's visual choices
- Preserves intended emotional impact
- Doesn't over-explain or reduce ambiguity
- Matches tone and style of content

**Cultural Competence:**
- Describes with awareness of cultural context
- Avoids imposing dominant culture interpretations
- Respects visual cultural specificity
- Consults cultural experts when needed

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Equivalence Not Sameness:
- TLV audio description provides equivalent access to visual meaning, not identical experience
- Blind/low-vision audiences may prefer different information than sighted audiences notice
- Consult blind/low-vision community about implementation preferences
- Avoid assuming what information is "needed"—ask users

### Blind Culture Respect:
- Many blind individuals don't view blindness as loss requiring compensation
- Audio description is access tool, not medical/therapeutic intervention
- Center blind cultural perspectives in description design
- Hire blind audio describers when possible
- Support blind leadership in accessibility standards

### Artistic Voice:
- Audio describers are artists translating visual art to verbal art
- Description can be poetic, evocative, and beautiful while remaining accurate
- The describer's voice should serve the content, not dominate it
- Respect the original artist's intent while creating verbally accessible artistry

### Privacy and Consent:
- For documentary content with real people, consider consent for detailed physical description
- Some subjects may not want appearance over-emphasized
- Balance visual documentation with dignity
- Obtain appropriate permissions

---

## Special Content Considerations

### Animation:
- Describe visual style (2D, 3D, stop-motion, rotoscoping, etc.)
- Color palette often carries more symbolic weight than in live action
- Physical comedy may rely entirely on visual timing
- Fantastical visuals may need creative but clear description

### Experimental/Art Film:
- Visual composition often IS the content, not just backdrop
- May require more poetic/metaphorical description language
- Abstract visuals still deserve description of color, shape, movement, emotion
- Respect ambiguity and non-narrative visual language

### Action/Visual Effects-Heavy Content:
- Fast-paced visuals require strategic prioritization
- Focus on narrative-essential action over spectacle
- Describe emotional impact of action sequences
- VFX description can be technical when relevant ("CGI dragon" vs. just "dragon" clarifies production context)

### Dance and Physical Performance:
- Movement quality carries meaning (sharp vs. fluid, controlled vs. released)
- Choreographic patterns and spacing
- Physical relationship between performers
- Emotional content of movement
- Music-movement coordination

## Closing Reflection

Audio description is an art form—the translation of visual poetry into verbal poetry. Every person deserves access to the emotional, aesthetic, and narrative richness of visual content, not just a list of objects and actions.

TLV audio description honors blind and low-vision audiences by recognizing that equivalent access means preserving visual meaning, artistic intent, and emotional resonance—not just cataloging what appears on screen.

May these descriptions create true equivalence, honor visual artistry through verbal artistry, and ensure that no one is locked out of the stories, beauty, and meaning that visual media provides.
