---

## 3. Precise Evocation and Intent

### Speaker Experience
- Internal experience: [what the speaker feels internally]
- Communicative intent: [what the speaker aims to convey]

### Listener Response
- Expected response: [how listeners typically receive this]
- Understanding challenges: [potential misunderstandings]

### Somatic Markers
- Physical indicators: [specific body sensations, postures, expressions]
- Activation patterns: [where and how this shows up in the body]

### Cognitive Associations
- Related concepts: [connected thoughts, memories, meanings]

### Somatic Evocation
- Physical resonance: [detailed sensation patterns in the body]
- Embodied authenticity: [how genuine expression feels vs. performed]
- Kinesthetic response: [movement patterns, gestures, behaviors]

---

## 4. Conceptual Explanation

### Core Concept
- Essential meaning: [fundamental idea or experience]

### Phenomenology
- Lived experience: [what it's like to experience this]

### Relational Context
- Interpersonal dynamics: [how this shows up in relationships]

### Temporal Aspect
- Duration and timing: [how this unfolds over time]

### Intensity Spectrum
- Range: [from subtle to overwhelming, with 1-10 scale markers]

### Embodied Conceptual Framework
- Mind-body integration: [how thought and feeling connect physically]
- Phenomenological embodiment: [whole-person expression]
- Somatic meaning: [what the body knows about this]

### Intensity Mapping (1-10) 
- **1-3:** [subtle experience description]
- **4-6:** [moderate experience description]
- **7-8:** [strong experience description]
- **9-10:** [overwhelming/peak experience description]

**Intensity Mapping Measurement Protocol:**

Intensity is calibrated through analysis of two primary dimensions:

1. **Lexical Intensity** - Semantic weight and emotional valence of word selection
2. **Paralinguistic Intensity** - Deviation from established vocal baseline in:
   - Pitch variation
   - Speech rate changes  
   - Volume modulation
   - Articulation precision
   - Pausal patterns

**Baseline Establishment Hierarchy:**
- Primary: Neutral vocal delivery within the current work
- Secondary: Documented neutral delivery from speaker's collective works
- Tertiary: Culturally normative neutral speech patterns (when no speaker-specific baseline exists)

**Measurement Principle:** Intensity represents the compound deviation from baseline across lexical and paralinguistic dimensions, calibrated to the 1-10 scale.

## Implementation Notes

This template provides a systematic structure for documenting emotional vocabulary within the TLV framework. Each entry should be developed with attention to accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and practical utility—serving real human needs for precise emotional language across contexts, cultures, and time.

The template supports authentic documentation of human experience without imposing new frameworks or making grandiose claims. It simply organizes and makes accessible the rich emotional language that already exists across human traditions.
