## Mission
To provide clear, precise emotional and feeling vocabulary that supports authentic documentation of human experience within the TLV framework. This vocabulary serves as a practical tool for anyone seeking to name and honor the full spectrum of emotional and embodied experience—accessible to all users, grounded in real human needs, and built with humility and respect[1][2][3].

## Core Philosophy
Emotional language is essential for documenting the complete human experience. This vocabulary provides systematic tools for describing emotions, feelings, and somatic states with precision and cultural sensitivity. Rather than imposing new frameworks, TLV vocabulary acknowledges and documents the rich emotional language that already exists across cultures, disciplines, and traditions—making it accessible and organized for practical use[1][2][3].

## Purpose and Scope
This emotional vocabulary supports all TLV protocols (Transcription, Translation, Communication) by providing:
- **38 emotional categories** covering the full spectrum of human feeling
- **Six-dimensional word documentation** for each emotion: etymology, contemporary usage, precise intent, conceptual explanation, cultural translation, and TLV application
- **Somatic signature documentation** linking emotions to physical sensations and embodied experience
- **Intensity mapping (1–10)** for calibrating emotional depth across contexts
- **Cultural bridge examples** showing how emotions translate authentically across worldviews
- **Temporal translation notes** ensuring emotional language remains meaningful across time

## Six-Dimensional Word Documentation Framework

### 1. Etymology and Historical Development
- Root language and original meaning

- Cultural shifts in usage and understanding
- Temporal evolution patterns

### 2. Contemporary Common Usage
- Primary and secondary definitions
- Colloquial usage and register (formal/informal/technical)
- Frequency trends
- Intensity calibration
- Temporal vulnerability (aspects likely to become obsolete)

### 3. Precise Evocation and Intent
- Speaker experience (what the speaker intends to communicate)
- Listener response (expected emotional resonance)
- Somatic markers (bodily sensations)
- Cognitive associations
- Intensity mapping
- Authenticity markers (genuine vs. performed emotion)

### 4. Conceptual Explanation
- Core concept and phenomenology
- Relational context
- Temporal aspect
- Intensity spectrum
- Universal emotional elements

### 5. Cultural Translation Contexts
- Framework perspectives: Western, Eastern, Indigenous, Clinical, Spiritual, Philosophical
- Cross-cultural variations
- Translation challenges
- Universal elements
- Cultural intensity calibration
- **Cultural bridge examples** demonstrating lived translation between worldviews

### 6. TLV Protocol Application
- Usage in Speaker's Voice, Emotional/Somatic Voice, and Observer's Voice
- Precision level requirements
- Cross-cultural bridge applications
- Potential misunderstandings
- Intensity applications

## Somatic Signature Documentation
Each emotion includes comprehensive embodied documentation:
- **Physical location mapping:** Primary and secondary body regions
- **Sensation quality:** Texture, temperature, pressure, movement
- **Kinesthetic response patterns:** Postural, gestural, breathing, movement tendencies
- **Neurobiological correlates:** Brain activation, chemical signatures, autonomic responses
- **Somatic intensity mapping (1–10):** From whisper-level to paradigm-shifting
- **Resonance practices:** Emotional regulation, grounding, integration techniques
- **Cultural somatic variations:** Universal and culture-specific patterns
- **Temporal somatic evolution:** Historical, contemporary, and future understanding

## Intensity Mapping (1–10 Scale)
- **1–3:** Subtle recognition, gentle shifts, quiet significance
- **4–6:** Clear experience, definite expression, notable somatic markers
- **7–8:** Strong engagement, compelling physical/emotional presence
- **9–10:** Peak experience, overwhelming intensity, paradigm-shifting

Applied across all dimensions (physical, emotional, somatic, cultural) with recognition that intensity expression varies by culture and context.

**Intensity Mapping Measurement Protocol:**

Intensity is calibrated through analysis of two primary dimensions:

1. **Lexical Intensity** - Semantic weight and emotional valence of word selection
2. **Paralinguistic Intensity** - Deviation from established vocal baseline in:
   - Pitch variation
   - Speech rate changes  
   - Volume modulation
   - Articulation precision
   - Pausal patterns

**Baseline Establishment Hierarchy:**
- Primary: Neutral vocal delivery within the current work
- Secondary: Documented neutral delivery from speaker's collective works
- Tertiary: Culturally normative neutral speech patterns (when no speaker-specific baseline exists)

**Measurement Principle:** Intensity represents the compound deviation from baseline across lexical and paralinguistic dimensions, calibrated to the 1-10 scale.

### Establishing and Documenting Baseline

**For Each Speaker/Communication, Document:**

1. **Vocal Baseline Specifics:**
   - Natural pitch range (describe and measure if possible)
   - Typical speech rate in words per minute
   - Default volume level
   - Characteristic timbre and tone qualities

2. **Physical Baseline Specifics:**
   - Default posture and stance
   - Habitual gesture patterns
   - Typical level of physical animation
   - Baseline facial expressiveness

3. **Emotional Baseline Specifics:**
   - Speaker's typical operating intensity (e.g., "This speaker's baseline is 6-8/10 intensity" vs. "This speaker's baseline is 3-5/10 intensity")
   - Commonly expressed emotions in neutral contexts
   - How speaker signals authenticity vs. performance

**Why Speaker-Specific Baseline Matters:**

Some speakers operate at high intensity even in neutral moments—their "calm" is others' "animated." Some speakers are naturally low-key—their "intense" might still be subdued compared to high-energy speakers.

**Intensity ratings measure deviation from that speaker's baseline, not universal norms.**

**Example:**

**Speaker A Baseline:** 3-5/10 intensity, soft-spoken, minimal gestures, contained affect
- Speaker A reaching 8/10 = significant deviation = peak moment for this speaker

**Speaker B Baseline:** 6-8/10 intensity, animated, expressive, high energy  
- Speaker B reaching 8/10 = within normal range = not particularly intense for this speaker
- Speaker B reaching 10/10 = significant deviation = peak moment for this speaker

**Both speakers can have 10/10 peak moments, but the journey to get there differs based on baseline.**

**Document baseline early in transcription to calibrate all subsequent intensity ratings.**

## Cultural Bridge Examples
Practical scenarios showing how emotions authentically translate between frameworks:
- **Western ↔ Eastern Bridge:** Individual psychological concepts and energy/qi frameworks
- **Eastern ↔ Indigenous Bridge:** Energy practices and community/nature/spiritual perspectives
- **Clinical ↔ Spiritual Bridge:** Medical/diagnostic and religious/mystical understandings
- **Living Bridge Protocol:** How an elder from one culture would explain an emotion to a child from another culture

These bridges maintain emotional authenticity of both perspectives, identify universal elements without hierarchy, and honor genuine cultural voices rather than stereotypes.

## Temporal Translation Integration
Each emotion includes considerations for understanding across time:
- **Current usage evolution:** How the emotion is presently understood
- **Temporal vulnerability:** Aspects likely to become obsolete or misunderstood
- **Future anchoring:** Universal emotional elements transcending temporal boundaries
- **Era-specific markers:** How emotions were/are/will be expressed
- **Translation bridges:** Connecting past understanding to future relevance

## 38 Emotional Categories
Joy/Happiness, Love/Affection, Anger/Rage, Sadness/Grief, Fear/Anxiety, Surprise/Wonder, Disgust/Aversion, Shame/Guilt, Pride/Confidence, Envy/Jealousy, Contempt/Disdain, Curiosity/Interest, Boredom/Apathy, Hope/Optimism, Despair/Pessimism, Gratitude/Appreciation, Resentment/Bitterness, Compassion/Empathy, Indifference/Detachment, Excitement/Enthusiasm, Calm/Serenity, Confusion/Perplexity, Clarity/Understanding, Longing/Yearning, Satisfaction/Contentment, Frustration/Irritation, Awe/Reverence, Nostalgia/Wistfulness, Anticipation/Expectation, Relief/Release, Vulnerability/Exposure, Strength/Power, Isolation/Loneliness, Connection/Belonging, Trust/Faith, Suspicion/Doubt, Acceptance/Surrender, Resistance/Defiance

Each category receives full six-dimensional documentation, somatic signature mapping, cultural bridge examples, and temporal translation notes.

## Quality and Integration Standards

### Cultural Bridge Quality Assurance
- Bridge examples demonstrate lived experience, not theoretical comparison
- Each bridge maintains emotional authenticity of both perspectives
- Universal elements identified without cultural hierarchy or appropriation
- Community contribution framework honors genuine cultural voices

### Temporal Translation Standards
- Current usage accurately reflects contemporary understanding
- Future anchoring preserves essential emotional truth across time
- Temporal vulnerability assessment prevents obsolescence
- Wisdom bridges connect to universal human truths

### Somatic Integration Standards
- Calibration prioritizes authentic experience over performed emotion
- Anatomical accuracy with specific body region terminology
- Cultural sensitivity honors embodiment traditions
- Therapeutic integration uses trauma-informed approaches
- Temporal sensitivity recognizes evolving somatic understanding

## Applications
- **Personal Communication:** Precise language for expressing authentic feelings
- **Healthcare and Therapy:** Person-centered emotional documentation
