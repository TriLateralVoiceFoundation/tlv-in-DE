## Mission

To transform closed captioning from basic accessibility compliance into rich, dimensional documentation that preserves the full communicative experience for Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and all viewers. TLV captioning honors what is said, how it is felt and expressed, and why it matters—ensuring that captions provide equivalent access to meaning, not just words.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Current captioning standards provide word access. TLV captioning provides meaning access.**

Deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences deserve the same rich, nuanced understanding of content that hearing audiences receive through tone, music, sound effects, and atmospheric audio. TLV captioning systematically documents all three voices of communication, creating captions that preserve emotional resonance, contextual significance, and authentic experience.

---

## Scope and Purpose

### What This Protocol IS:

- **An enhancement framework**: Builds on existing captioning standards (ADA, WCAG, FCC) to add dimensional depth
- **An accessibility advancement**: Provides equivalent access to emotional and contextual information, not just dialogue
- **A documentation method**: Preserves full communicative experience in text form
- **A training resource**: Teaches captioners to document beyond words
- **A quality standard**: Raises bar for what constitutes truly accessible media

### What This Protocol IS NOT:

- **Not a replacement for standard captions**: TLV-enhanced captions must still meet legal/technical requirements
- **Not audio description**: Captions document speech/sound; audio description documents visual content (see companion protocol)
- **Not interpretation**: Captions document what is communicated, not what captioner thinks it means
- **Not excessive text**: TLV captions are strategic, not exhaustive
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: Implementation varies by content type and audience needs

### Accessibility Note:

This protocol assumes captions are **one component** of accessible media. Full accessibility requires:
- TLV-enhanced captions (this protocol)
- TLV-informed audio description (companion protocol)
- Accessible player controls and interfaces
- Multiple format options when possible
- Community input on accessibility needs

## The Three Voices in Captioning

### 1. Speaker's Voice (What Is Said)
**The verbatim dialogue and spoken content**: Preserves exact words, following standard captioning conventions.

**Includes:**
- All dialogue, exactly as spoken
- On-screen text/titles when relevant
- Song lyrics when integral to content
- Voiced-over narration
- Speakers identified clearly

**Standard Captioning Rules Apply:**
- Accuracy, synchronization, completeness
- Speaker identification
- Proper grammar/spelling in captions (even if speech is non-standard)
- Reading level appropriate to audience

### 2. Emotional/Somatic Voice (How It Is Felt/Expressed)
**The paralinguistic and emotional dimensions**: Documents tone, vocal quality, emotional expression, and meaningful sounds beyond words.

**Includes:**
- Vocal tone and emotional quality
- Volume, pitch, rate variations
- Emotional states when significant
- Meaningful sounds (crying, laughter, gasps, sighs)
- Music and sound effects that carry emotional/narrative weight
- Silence when weighted or significant

**TLV Enhancement:**
Rather than generic [crying] or [tense music], provide emotional context:
- [voice breaking with grief]
- [sharp intake of breath - shocked]
- [tense string music builds suspense]
- [child's laughter - pure joy]

### 3. Observer's Voice (Why It Matters / Context)
**The contextual and narrative significance**: Provides context that hearing viewers get from atmosphere, music, and sound design.

**Includes:**
- Atmospheric audio that shapes meaning (distant sirens, approaching storm)
- Sound effects that carry narrative information (door slam indicating anger, footsteps approaching)
- Music that signals tone shifts or emotional subtext
- Off-screen sounds that provide story context
- Acoustic environment when relevant to understanding

**TLV Enhancement:**
Rather than just documenting sounds, document their significance:
- [distant sirens growing louder - danger approaching]
- [door slams - conversation over abruptly]
- [ominous orchestral swell - threat revealed]
- [silence - weighted pause before difficult truth]

**Note:** The Observer's Voice in captioning is **external documentary witnessing**—the captioner documents atmospheric, musical, and contextual information that provides equivalent access to meaning for caption users. This differs from internal Observer's Voice (self-witnessing) which individual viewers may engage with content. See: *Understanding the Observer's Voice: Internal vs. External Witnessing*

## Why Three Voices in Captioning?

**Because captions that only document words provide partial access, not equivalent access.**

### Current Standard Captioning:
> "I'm fine."

**Missing for caption users:**
- Tone: Is this said flatly? Angrily? Sarcastically? Tearfully?
- Context: What sounds/music surround this statement?
- Significance: Is this a turning point? A lie? A relief?

### TLV-Enhanced Captioning:
> [Emma, voice tight with controlled emotion]
> "I'm fine."
> [tense silence - her father doesn't believe her]

**What TLV captures:**
- **Speaker's Voice**: The words "I'm fine"
- **Emotional/Somatic Voice**: Voice tight with controlled emotion
- **Observer's Voice**: Tense silence and implied disbelief provide narrative context

**Result**: Caption users receive equivalent access to the emotional and narrative complexity that hearing viewers get from vocal tone and atmospheric sound.

## TLV Captioning Notation System

### Speaker Identification:
**Standard format:**
> SPEAKER NAME: Dialogue

**Enhanced for clarity:**
> [Sarah, whispering urgently]
> Don't make a sound.

### Emotional/Tonal Notation:
Use brackets before or integrated with dialogue:

> [voice shaking with rage]
> "How dare you."

> "I love you."
> [said quietly, without conviction]

### Sound Effect Notation:
**Standard:** [sound description]

**TLV-Enhanced:** [sound description with emotional/narrative context]

**Examples:**
- Standard: [thunder]
- Enhanced: [sudden crack of thunder - makes everyone jump]

- Standard: [music playing]
- Enhanced: [joyful jazz music - celebration atmosphere]

- Standard: [phone ringing]
- Enhanced: [phone rings insistently - fourth call in a row]

### Music Notation:
Describe music's emotional/narrative function:

> [ominous string music begins - foreshadowing danger]
> [triumphant orchestral swell - victory achieved]
> [melancholic piano - grief and memory]
> [upbeat pop music - party scene energy]

### Silence Notation:
When silence carries meaning:

> [weighted pause before answer]
> [stunned silence - shock at revelation]
> [peaceful quiet - moment of connection]
> [tense silence - standoff continues]

## Practical Examples: TLV Captioning in Action

### Example 1: Dramatic Scene

**Standard Captioning:**
```
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
PARENT: No.
DOCTOR: We did everything we could.
[parent crying]
```

**TLV-Enhanced Captioning:**
```
[Dr. Chen, voice heavy with grief]
I'm sorry.

[Parent, voice breaking]
No.

[Dr. Chen, struggling to maintain professional composure]
We did everything we could.

[parent's sobs - raw, uncontrollable grief]
[quiet instrumental music - mournful strings]
```

**What's gained:** Emotional depth, doctor's own difficulty (not just clinical), specific character of grief, atmospheric music support.

---

### Example 2: Comedy Scene

**Standard Captioning:**
```
ALEX: That's not what I meant!
[audience laughter]
JAMIE: Sure it wasn't.
```

**TLV-Enhanced Captioning:**
```
[Alex, flustered and talking too fast]
That's not what I meant!

[live audience laughter - recognition of awkwardness]

[Jamie, deadpan with perfect comic timing]
Sure it wasn't.

[laughter intensifies]
```

**What's gained:** Comic timing markers, specific type of laughter (recognition vs. shock), deadpan delivery cue, escalation pattern.

---

### Example 3: Thriller Scene

**Standard Captioning:**
```
[footsteps]
[door creaks]
SARAH: Hello?
[music]
```

**TLV-Enhanced Captioning:**
```
[slow, heavy footsteps approaching from darkness]

[door creaks open slowly - no one visible]

[Sarah, voice tight with fear trying to sound brave]
Hello?

[silence - no answer]

[sudden sharp violin screech - jumpscare moment]
```

**What's gained:** Pacing information, specific quality of sounds, character's emotional state, narrative function of music and silence.

---

### Example 4: Documentary Interview

**Standard Captioning:**
```
WITNESS: I'll never forget that day.
[emotional]
It changed everything.
```

**TLV-Enhanced Captioning:**
```
[Maria Rodriguez, survivor - voice steady but hands trembling]
I'll never forget that day.

[long pause - gathering strength to continue]

[voice breaks slightly]
It changed everything.

[subtle documentary score fades in - reflective, honoring her testimony]
```

**What's gained:** Survivor context, embodied trauma markers (trembling), weighted pause meaning, specific vocal shift, music's respectful framing.

---

**Access improvement:** Significant

### Level 2: Comprehensive TLV Enhancement (Moderate)
**Full three-voice documentation:**
- All emotional/tonal markers
- Detailed sound/music context
- Silence and pause notation
- Narrative significance markers

**Time investment:** ~30-40% more than standard captioning
**Access improvement:** Substantial

### Level 3: Artistic TLV Enhancement (Premium)
**Fully dimensional experience:**
- Nuanced emotional documentation
- Atmospheric and environmental audio fully captured
- Cultural/contextual notes when needed
- Equivalent aesthetic experience for caption users

**Time investment:** ~50-60% more than standard captioning
**Access improvement:** Equivalent access to full artistic intent

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Equivalence Not Sameness:
- TLV captions provide equivalent access to meaning, not identical experience
- Deaf/HoH viewers may prefer different information than hearing viewers receive
- Consult Deaf/HoH community about implementation preferences
- Avoid assuming what information is "needed"—ask users

### Deaf Culture Respect:
- Many Deaf individuals don't view deafness as loss requiring compensation
- Captions are access tool, not medical/therapeutic intervention
- Center Deaf cultural perspectives in caption design
- Hire Deaf captioners when possible

### Artistic Integrity:
- Enhanced captions should preserve creator's intent
- Don't over-explain or interpret beyond what's present
- Respect ambiguity when it's intentional
- Consult with content creators about TLV enhancement

### Privacy and Consent:
- For documentary/interview content, confirm subjects approve enhanced emotional description
- Some speakers may not want emotional state documented
- Respect boundaries around trauma content
- Obtain appropriate permissions

---

## Applications

## Closing Reflection

Captions are not just text on screen—they are a bridge to full participation in media culture. Every person deserves access to the emotional, contextual, and narrative richness of content, not just the words.

TLV captioning honors Deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences by recognizing that equivalent access means preserving meaning, feeling, and significance—not just transcribing dialogue.

May these captions create true equivalence, honor the full dimensionality of content, and ensure that no one is locked out of the stories, information, and connections that media provides.

---

**DRAFT STATUS: This protocol is in development. Feedback from Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, professional captioners, content creators, and accessibility experts is essential for refinement. Please provide input to improve this framework.**
