## Mission

To preserve and transmit the full dimensionality of human experience across linguistic and cultural boundaries—honoring the technical, emotional, somatic, and contextual realities of each speaker. TLV's translation protocol provides accessible, practical tools to ensure that every voice can be understood across languages with dignity, clarity, and authenticity, without abstraction or grandiosity.

---

## Core Philosophy

Translation is more than converting words—it is bridge-building between cultures, worldviews, and human experiences. TLV translation preserves not only semantic content but also emotional resonance, cultural context, and the lived significance of what is communicated. We translate meaning, not just words.

---

## Scope and Purpose

### What This Protocol IS:

- **A cross-cultural bridge**: Systematic method for preserving meaning across languages and cultures
- **A preservation tool**: Maintains full dimensionality when moving between linguistic worlds
- **A research framework**: Enables cross-cultural analysis while honoring source authenticity
- **An accessibility resource**: Makes communication available to non-speakers while preserving cultural integrity
- **A training guide**: Teaches comprehensive translation that honors both source and target cultures

### What This Protocol IS NOT:

- **Not machine translation**: TLV translation requires cultural knowledge, not just linguistic conversion
- **Not cultural appropriation**: We bridge cultures; we don't claim to speak for them
- **Not interpretation**: Translation renders words; interpretation explains meaning (though TLV informs both)
- **Not therapy or clinical work**: Translation documents; it does not diagnose or treat
- **Not colonization**: We preserve source voice; we don't reshape it for target convenience

### When to Seek Additional Support:

Translation work involving:
- Trauma testimony requiring specialized expertise
- Legal documents requiring certified translation
- Medical or clinical contexts requiring professional credentials
- Sacred or ceremonial content requiring community authorization
- Complex cultural concepts requiring consultation with cultural keepers

Appropriate professional support or community consultation may be needed beyond documentation.

## The Three Voices: A Practical Framework for Translation

TLV translation documents three distinct but integrated dimensions across linguistic and cultural boundaries:

### 1. Speaker's Voice (What Was Said - With Cultural Weight)
**The verbal content translated with cultural integrity**: The semantic meaning, narrative, and message rendered in target language while preserving source cultural framing.

**Translation includes:**
- Verbatim meaning (not word-for-word but meaning-for-meaning)
- Cultural concepts that don't directly translate (with explanation)
- Idioms and metaphors (with cultural context when needed)
- Technical or specialized terminology (with glosses if necessary)
- Narrative structure and rhetorical style (preserved where possible)
- Words that carry specific cultural weight (noted and explained)

### 2. Emotional/Somatic Voice (How It Felt Across Cultures)
**The felt, embodied experience translated with emotional authenticity**: The emotional states and somatic responses, acknowledging that emotions may be expressed and experienced differently across cultures.

**Translation includes:**
- Primary emotions identified (using appropriate vocabulary for both cultures)
- Culturally specific emotional concepts that don't translate directly
- Somatic expressions and their cultural meanings
- Intensity levels calibrated for both source and target cultural norms
- Paralinguistic markers and their cultural interpretation
- Emotional authenticity vs. performance in both cultural contexts

### 3. Observer's Voice (Why It Matters - Context Across Boundaries)
**The contextual significance and cultural bridge**: The broader meaning, cultural frameworks, and circumstances that help target audience understand source communication.

**Translation includes:**
- Cultural context necessary for understanding
- Historical or political circumstances shaping communication
- Power dynamics in both source and target contexts
- Relational and social frameworks specific to source culture
- Translator's position and relationship to both cultures
- Bridge-building notes explaining gaps or differences
- Why this communication matters in both cultural frameworks

### Understanding Observer's Voice in Translation: Cultural Bridge-Building

The Observer's Voice in translation is **external documentary witnessing** with cultural bridge-building—the translator's documentation of significance across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

#### **What Translators Document (External Observer's Voice):**

- Cultural context necessary for target audience understanding
- Historical or political circumstances shaping communication
- Power dynamics in both source and target contexts
- Translator's position and relationship to both cultures
- Bridge-building notes explaining cultural gaps or differences
- Why communication matters in both cultural frameworks

#### **What This Is NOT:**

- ❌ Translator imposing their cultural framework onto source content
- ❌ "Fixing" or "improving" source communication for target audience
- ❌ Speaking for source culture rather than amplifying source voices

#### **Capturing Source Speaker's Internal Observer's Voice:**

Source speakers may express meta-awareness that should be preserved in translation:
- Cultural self-commentary about their own communication
- Explicit pattern recognition ("I always respond this way when...")
- Meta-linguistic awareness ("This concept doesn't translate well, but I mean...")

**When this occurs:** Translate the speaker's self-observation as part of their communication, noting in Observer's Voice when this meta-awareness is culturally specific and may need contextual explanation for target audience.

#### **The Distinction in Translation:**

**Internal Observer's Voice (Source speaker's self-witnessing):**
- Source: "I notice I code-switch between languages when discussing emotional topics"
- Function: Speaker's meta-awareness of their own patterns
- Translation: Preserve this self-observation in target language

**External Observer's Voice (Translator's cultural bridge):**
- Translator note: [Code-switching between Spanish and English is common in this bilingual community when discussing emotional content; Spanish often carries affective weight that English doesn't for this speaker]
- Function: Contextual explanation enabling target audience understanding
- Translation: Clearly marked as translator's cultural contextualization

The translator must preserve source speaker's self-awareness while adding necessary cultural context without conflating the two.

For complete exploration of this distinction, see: *Understanding the Observer's Voice: Internal vs. External Witnessing*

## Why Three Voices in Translation?

The three-voice structure becomes even more critical in translation, where meaning can easily be lost or distorted.

### The Structure Explained:

**First Voice (Speaker's Voice):** What was communicated in source language—rendered faithfully in target language while preserving cultural integrity and weight.

**Second Voice (Emotional/Somatic Voice):** How it was felt in source culture—translated with awareness that emotions may be named, expressed, and experienced differently across cultural boundaries.

**Third Voice (Observer's Voice / Cultural Bridge):** Why it matters and what connects it—the cultural context, frameworks, and translator's observations that enable understanding across difference.

### Why Three Specifically in Translation?

Because **direct word-for-word translation often fails to preserve meaning**. Languages and cultures organize reality differently—what takes one word in one language may require a paragraph in another; what seems neutral in one culture may carry enormous weight in another.

**Without the Emotional/Somatic Voice**, we lose the felt dimension that shapes how words should be understood. "Anger" in one culture may map onto several distinct emotional concepts in another culture, each with different somatic expressions and social meanings.

**Without the Observer's Voice**, readers in the target culture lack the frameworks to understand why something was said, what it implies socially, and what cultural knowledge the original speaker and audience shared.

**Example**: The Japanese concept of [translate:amae] (甘え) doesn't directly translate to English. A literal translation might be "to depend and presume upon another's benevolence," but this misses the emotional complexity, the positive cultural value, and the relational context that make [translate:amae] meaningful in Japanese culture. The Observer's Voice would explain this cultural framework, enabling English readers to grasp what speakers are actually communicating when they use this concept.

**TLV translation serves dual purposes:**

1. **Immediate communication**: Enables people across language barriers to understand each other
2. **Cultural preservation**: Maintains the integrity of source communication rather than forcing it into target cultural frameworks

This structure acknowledges that complete translation requires preserving not just words, but the felt experience and cultural context that make those words meaningful. Without all three voices, translation becomes linguistic conversion—accurate perhaps, but stripped of life.

---

## Intensity Mapping Across Cultures

TLV translation uses structured intensity measurement while acknowledging cultural differences in emotional expression:

### 1. Lexical Intensity in Both Languages
The semantic weight and emotional valence of word choices in source and target:
- Word selection in source language and closest equivalents in target
- Culturally specific concepts that intensify or soften meaning
- Metaphors and idioms that carry emotional weight
- Register and formality levels in both languages

### 2. Paralinguistic Intensity Across Cultural Norms
Observable deviations from cultural baseline norms:
- Vocal patterns in source culture vs. target culture norms
- Volume, pitch, rate calibrated against appropriate cultural baselines
- Gestures, facial expressions, and body language (culture-specific)
- Pauses, silences, and their cultural meanings

### Baseline Establishment Across Cultures:

**Source Culture Baseline**: Neutral communication patterns for speaker's cultural and linguistic context

**Target Culture Baseline**: Neutral communication patterns for target audience's cultural and linguistic context

**Comparative Calibration**: Note where source intensity may map to different perceived intensity in target culture

### Cross-Cultural Intensity Notation:

When translating, note both source and target intensity if they differ significantly:

> "I absolutely refuse!" [Source intensity: 7/10 in English context; Target intensity: 9/10 if directly translated to Japanese context, where direct refusal carries much stronger social weight]

Or:

> "It might be difficult..." [Source intensity: 7/10 in Japanese context as strong disagreement expressed indirectly; Target intensity: 3/10 if rendered literally in English without cultural context]

---

## Practical Examples: Three Voices in Translation

### Example 1: Healthcare Context - Japanese to English

**Source (Japanese):**
> [translate:お腹が痛いというより、なんか重い感じで、ずっと気になっています。]

**Speaker's Voice (English Translation):**
> "Rather than saying my stomach hurts, it's more like a heavy feeling, and it's been bothering me constantly."

**Emotional/Somatic Voice:**
- Source Culture Emotion: [translate:Ki ni naru] (気になる) - a specifically Japanese concept of something weighing on one's mind/body; concern with somatic component
- English Approximation: Worry (5/10), Discomfort (6/10), Preoccupation (7/10)
- Somatic: "Heavy feeling" ([translate:omoi kanji] 重い感じ) - culturally specific somatic description common in Japanese medical contexts
- Intensity: 6/10 in Japanese context (moderate concern expressed indirectly); might be perceived as 4/10 in English if cultural framing not understood

**Observer's Voice (Cultural Bridge):**
- Cultural Context: In Japanese medical communication, patients often describe symptoms using sensation words rather than pain scales; "heavy" ([translate:omoi]) is a common somatic descriptor
- Communication Style: The phrase "rather than saying" ([translate:というより]) reflects Japanese preference for indirect expression; this isn't minimizing—it's culturally normative communication
- Significance: The continuous nature ([translate:zutto] ずっと) elevates concern level; patient is indicating this is serious without direct statement
- Translator Position: Japanese-English bilingual familiar with both medical communication cultures
- Bridge Note: English-speaking healthcare providers should understand this represents moderate-to-significant concern that warrants attention, not casual mention

---

### Example 2: Conflict Resolution - Spanish to English

**Source (Spanish):**
> [translate:Me duele que no confíes en mí después de todo lo que hemos pasado juntos.]

**Speaker's Voice (English Translation):**
> "It hurts me that you don't trust me after everything we've been through together."

**Emotional/Somatic Voice:**
- Source Culture Emotion: [translate:Me duele] - "it hurts me" carries both physical and emotional pain; Spanish often embodies emotional pain somatically
- English Approximation: Hurt (8/10), Betrayal (6/10), Sadness (7/10)
- Somatic: The verb [translate:doler] (to hurt/ache) brings bodily sensation into emotional expression in Spanish more naturally than English "hurt"
- Intensity: 8/10 in Spanish context (high emotional expression); 7-8/10 in English (closely equivalent)

**Observer's Voice (Cultural Bridge):**
- Cultural Context: Spanish communication often expresses emotion more directly and intensely than English equivalents; this isn't overdramatization—it's culturally normative emotional expression
- Relational: "After everything we've been through together" ([translate:después de todo lo que hemos pasado juntos]) emphasizes shared history; Spanish cultures often prioritize relational history explicitly
- Significance: This statement combines hurt, accusation, and relationship appeal in one sentence; Spanish allows emotional complexity more compactly than English
- Translator Position: Spanish-English bilingual from Latin American context
- Bridge Note: English speakers should hear this as deeply felt hurt with relational significance, not simply complaint

---

### Example 3: Community Discussion - Arabic to English

**Source (Arabic):**
> [translate:والله، هذا الموضوع مهم جداً لمستقبل أولادنا]

**Speaker's Voice (English Translation):**
> "I swear by God, this matter is extremely important for our children's future."

**Emotional/Somatic Voice:**
- Source Culture Emotion: [translate:Wallahi] (والله) invokes God as witness to speaker's sincerity; combines conviction, seriousness, and spiritual weight
- English Approximation: Conviction (9/10), Concern (8/10), Seriousness (9/10)
- Intensity: 9/10 in Arabic context (very high seriousness); might be perceived as 10/10 by English speakers unfamiliar with this as routine intensifier in Arabic

**Observer's Voice (Cultural Bridge):**
- Cultural Context: [translate:Wallahi] (والله) is an extremely common intensifier in Arabic communication, used to emphasize sincerity; it's not taking an oath in Western religious sense
- Communication Pattern: Arabic rhetoric often uses repetition and intensifiers; what might seem "over the top" to English speakers is standard emphasis
- Religious/Cultural Frame: Invoking God is culturally normative in many Arabic-speaking communities for emphasis, across religious practice levels
- Significance: The speaker is marking this topic as worthy of serious community attention; "our children's future" invokes collective responsibility
- Translator Position: Arabic-English bilingual; Arab cultural background
- Bridge Note: English readers should understand this as "I'm being completely sincere that this issue requires serious attention for our community's next generation"—not as religious invocation in Western evangelical sense

## Translation Best Practices

### Preparation:
- **Understand both cultures deeply**: Don't just know languages; know cultural contexts
- **Research unfamiliar concepts**: Don't guess at cultural meanings
- **Establish purpose**: Who is target audience? What do they need to understand?
- **Identify cultural gaps**: Where will direct translation fail to convey meaning?
- **Prepare glossaries**: For recurring cultural concepts, technical terms

### During Translation:
- **Preserve source voice**: Resist urge to "fix" or "improve" source communication
- **Note untranslatable concepts**: Mark and explain cultural concepts that don't transfer
- **Maintain register and tone**: Formal stays formal, intimate stays intimate
- **Document your choices**: When multiple translations possible, note why you chose this one
- **Ask for help**: Consult cultural experts when needed
- **Mark uncertainty**: Better to say "approximate translation" than to claim false precision

### Quality Control:
- **Back-translate**: Have someone translate your work back to source language
- **Cultural consultation**: Have members of both cultures review for accuracy and appropriateness
- **Check emotional authenticity**: Does target language version carry same feeling as source?
- **Verify context preservation**: Can target audience understand why this matters?
- **Ensure bridge-building**: Have you provided enough context without over-explaining?

---

## Ethical Standards

### Cultural Respect and Humility:
- Acknowledge your positionality and limitations
- Don't claim expertise in cultures not your own without appropriate training/authorization
- Seek permission for translating sacred, ceremonial, or restricted content
- Credit cultural consultants and collaborators
- Share power in translation process when possible (participatory translation)

### Accuracy and Fidelity:
- Preserve source meaning even when inconvenient for target audience
- Don't sanitize, smooth, or "improve" source communication
- Mark any omissions, summaries, or adaptations clearly
- When cultural concepts don't translate, explain rather than substitute
- Be honest about translation limitations

### Privacy and Consent:
- Obtain consent before translating personal or sensitive communications
- Protect identifying information when required
- Follow privacy laws in both source and target contexts
- Be transparent about who will access translations
- Store translations securely

### Power and Representation:
- Recognize translation is always interpretation shaped by translator's position
- Don't speak for communities; amplify their voices
- Address power imbalances between source and target languages/cultures
- Ensure marginalized voices aren't sanitized for dominant audience comfort
- Support source community's control over their own narratives

---

## Special Translation Contexts

### Sacred or Ceremonial Content:
- **Seek authorization**: From appropriate cultural or spiritual authorities
- **Respect restrictions**: Some content may not be meant for translation
- **Preserve sacred language**: May keep certain words/phrases in source language
- **Explain spiritual context**: Without violating restricted knowledge
- **Work collaboratively**: With cultural keepers and community members

### Trauma Testimony:
- **Maintain dignity**: Preserve speaker's voice without re-traumatizing through translation
- **Cultural trauma concepts**: Understand how trauma is named and experienced differs culturally
- **Somatic translation**: Body-based trauma expressions may not translate directly
- **Context sensitivity**: Political, historical trauma requires careful framing
- **Support available**: Ensure translator has access to support; trauma content affects translators

### Power-Asymmetric Communications:
- **Preserve resistance**: When translating marginalized to dominant language, don't smooth critique
- **Maintain challenge**: Uncomfortable truths should remain uncomfortable
- **Note power dynamics**: In both source and target contexts
- **Amplify, don't filter**: Let marginalized voices speak with full force
- **Refuse complicity**: Don't make oppression palatable through translation choices

### Technical or Specialized Content:
- **Maintain precision**: Technical accuracy is crucial
- **Preserve ambiguity**: If source is uncertain, translation should be too
- **Provide glossaries**: For recurring technical terms
- **Note cultural difference**: In how fields/concepts are organized
- **Seek expert review**: From specialists in both languages when possible

---

## Quality Standards

### Semantic Accuracy:
- Meaning preserved across languages
- Cultural concepts explained when no equivalent exists
- Technical terminology translated precisely
- Ambiguity maintained where present in source

### Emotional Authenticity:
- Feeling tone equivalent in target language
- Cultural emotion concepts honored
- Intensity appropriately calibrated for both contexts
- Somatic expressions culturally grounded

### Cultural Integrity:
- Source cultural frameworks preserved
- Target audience given context to understand
- Power dynamics acknowledged
- Translator positionality stated

### Completeness:
- All three voices documented
- Cultural bridge-building sufficient
- Context adequate for understanding
- No unjustified omissions

---

## Applications

---

## How TLV Protocols Work Together

### Standalone Use:
**Translation Protocol** functions independently for moving communication across linguistic/cultural boundaries.

### Integrated Use:
- **With Transcription Protocol**: Transcribe in source language, then translate while preserving three voices
- **With Communication Protocol**: Understand communication patterns before translating them
- **With Conflict Mediation Protocol**: Translate conflict testimonies for cross-cultural understanding
- **With Emotional Vocabulary**: Build vocabulary resources across languages

Choose the protocols you need based on your actual context and goals. TLV is modular and flexible.

## Closing Reflection

Translation is an act of bridge-building and cultural witnessing. By documenting all three voices—what was said with cultural integrity, how it was felt across cultural boundaries, and why it matters in both worlds—you create understanding where walls once stood.

This isn't about perfect equivalence. It's about honest representation that honors source voices while giving target audiences enough context to understand across difference.

May your translations preserve truth across boundaries, honor cultural integrity with humility, and create bridges of understanding that respect both the distance and the connection between us.
